# Project: Leave Management System

## Objective
Develop a Leave Management System using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as the backend, and Flutter (or any modern framework) for the frontend. The system aims to allow employees to apply for leaves and view their leave history.

## Technical Objective
Create a secure, scalable, and responsive web application with a sound database schema design.

## Technical Stack
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Flutter (or any modern frontend framework like Vue.js, Angular.js, React.js)

## Features
1. **User Authentication:**
   - Implement user registration and login securely using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Implement roles (employee, manager) during user registration.
2. **Leave Application:**
   - Employees can apply for leaves by specifying the start date, end date, and reason.
3. **Leave Status:**
   - Display the status (pending, approved, or denied) of each leave request.
4. **Leave History:**
   - Allow employees to view their leave history, including past leave requests and their status.
5. **Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Managers should have additional permissions, such as the ability to approve or deny leave requests.
   - Each Manager should be able to view all the team members.
   - Managers should have the ability to add and delete team members.

### Extras (Bonus Points)
1. Implement a simple notification system for employees to receive status updates.
2. Include form validation for leave applications.
3. Add everyday attendance and time tracker.
4. Kudos if you implement the backend in Typescript.js

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Effective user authentication with roles.
2. Implementation of a leave application form.
3. Display of leave status and history.
4. Role-based access control for managers.
5. Bonus points for implementing extras.

## Submission
Candidates will submit the application using Bitbucket. The deadline for submission is Monday, December 4, 2023, at 6 PM. Below are the submission guidelines:

1. Create a user account on Bitbucket. The code repository is hosted here[https://bitbucket.org/sambuq-recruitment/wit]
2. Clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://phirlikar@bitbucket.org/sambuq-recruitment/wit.git`
3. Create a new branch from the master branch.
4. The branch name will be in the format - WIT_<LASTNAME>_<FIRSTNAME>_<BRANCH>_<SEMESTER>
   Example: WIT_KOLHI_VIRAT_CSE_6
   - Branch Codes:

5. The backend code will be submitted in the `src/back_end` folder.
6. The frontend code will be submitted in the `src/front_end` folder.
7. Do not commit any system-generated files in the repo.
8. Upload your latest resume in the resume folder.

**PLEASE NOTE:** The goal is to help us understand how well you can understand and develop software based on a set of requirements. Code quality, correctness and structure of the project will be given more weightage than the completeness of the assignment.

**GOOD LUCK! ðŸš€**
